        <p>👋 Hi there! I'm Ajinkya Sahastrabuddhe, currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and Business Systems at St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering & Technology. I’m passionate about web development and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

            💻 My core expertise includes:
            
            Programming Languages: Python, C, C++, SQL
            Web Development: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures
            
            📜 I have earned certifications in:
            
            Microsoft Copilot for Productivity (by Microsoft and LinkedIn)
            Prompt Engineering, AI for Business, and more
            🛠️ I’ve built several projects, including an E-commerce website, a Weather App, and a Population Finder project. During my internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I enhanced my technical and project management skills.
            
            📚 I recently authored a blog titled "Balancing Tech and Teamwork: Management Guide for Engineering Students", sharing insights on combining technology and leadership.
            
            🌟 I'm actively seeking entry-level opportunities in web development and the MERN stack. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to innovative solutions.
            
            Let’s connect and collaborate! 🚀</p>
